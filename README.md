# Image Generation Chatbot using Stable Diffusion

This project showcases an AI-powered chatbot built with Python and integrated with [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) to create a user-friendly interface for generating images based on text prompts. The image generation is powered by [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) through the `diffusers` library.

## Key Features
- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Enter a descriptive prompt, and the AI generates an image based on the input.
- **Gradio Integration**: Provides a web-based interface for seamless interaction.
- **GPU/CPU Compatibility**: The model automatically detects CUDA availability to utilize GPU for faster processing or falls back to CPU if needed.
- **Ease of Deployment**: Includes code tracing with `print` statements for better debugging and understanding of the execution flow.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:
- `torch`
- `diffusers`
- `gradio`

Install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install torch diffusers gradio
```

Install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install torch diffusers gradio
```
## Usage
Run the script to start the Gradio web application and access the chatbot through your browser at `http://localhost:8080.`
```bash
python script_name.py

```
Simply type a prompt into the interface, and the chatbot will return an AI-generated image!


## Example Prompt
```
"A serene landscape with mountains and a river during sunset"

```
